1. Show bookmarks filtered by group
2. If we have a favicon_url but it is invalid we still need to show something. how?
3. We must be able to change groups for a bookmark? check bkms.com with right click.
4. Will we allow custom naming?
5. Changed BookmarkSchema to have snake_case instead of camel because of how I get the data from the DB. Check errors and also study how is that managed because in the server, with the linter, I'm forced to use CamelCase
6. Trashcan button bg red with {cn}
7. Toasts sometimes don't leave the screen
8. refactor bookmark-card and index.tsx. We need an intermediate layer so that we can keep bookmark-card as only a presentational layer and have a CARD component that has a SINGLE card that shares state. Index.tsx will map over a single <Card bookmark={bookmark]/>
