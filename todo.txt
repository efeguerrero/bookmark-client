2. If we have a favicon_url but it is invalid we still need to show something. how?
3. We must be able to change groups for a bookmark? check bkms.com with right click.
4. Will we allow custom naming for bookmarks?
5. Trashcan button bg red with {cn}
6. Toasts sometimes don't leave the screen
7. refactor bookmark-card and index.tsx. We need an intermediate layer so that we can keep bookmark-card as only a presentational layer and have a CARD component that has a SINGLE card that shares state. Index.tsx will map over a single <Card bookmark={bookmark]/>
8. We are NEVER setting our queries as stale so we will never refetch in the background. Maybe set something like 3 minutes?
